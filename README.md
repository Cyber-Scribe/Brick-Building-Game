# Javascript-Tetris

The main gameplay is written in Javascript/HTML/CSS, but it also has some PHP code to talk to a MySQL database to save high scores. I used XMLHttpRequest in conjunction with PHP instead of form submit to avoid the page refreshing when sending data to the database.

I wrote this code from scratch entirely myself and am open to any feedback/criticism/advice. I am relatively new to coding so any advice would be great. I am completely self taught so may have picked up some bad habits along the way. To my knowledge I have ironed out most if not all the bugs.

The only issue with it is that it does not work in Explorer. I'm sure I could get it to work with a bit more effore but I have moved onto other projects now.

This is completely open source and you are free to re-use, ammend and take ideas from it as you want.
