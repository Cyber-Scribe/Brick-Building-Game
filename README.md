# Brick-Building-Game

This is a brick building game that in no way resembles any brick building games from before(!).

The main gameplay is written in Javascript, but it also has some PHP code to talk to a MySQL database to save high scores. I used XMLHttpRequest in conjunction with PHP instead of form submit to avoid the page refreshing when sending data to the database.

I wrote this code from scratch entirely myself and am open to any feedback/criticism/advice. I am relatively new to coding so any advice would be great. I am completely self taught so may have picked up some bad habits along the way. To my knowledge I have ironed out most if not all the bugs.

This is completely open source and you are free to re-use, ammend and take ideas from it as you want.
